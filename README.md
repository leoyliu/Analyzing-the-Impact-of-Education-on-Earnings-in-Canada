# Degrees of Difference: Analyzing the Impact of Education on Earnings in Canada

## Overview

This repository contains a replicated paper from [Kearney, Levine and Pardue (2022) 's paper, "The Puzzle of Falling US Birth Rates since the Great Recession"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.36.1.151). The paper delves into the long-term effects of the Great Recession on the fertility decisions of the young adult population in the U.S. It utilizes an extensive dataset from the National Vital Statistics Reports, spanning from 1980 to 2020, to analyze trends over time and across various demographics. Through a rigorous quantitative analysis, the study reveals a notable decline in birth rates among young Americans during and following the recession. The paper aims to provide insights into the relationship between economic stability and reproductive choices, highlighting the need for policies that support young individuals during economic crises.
