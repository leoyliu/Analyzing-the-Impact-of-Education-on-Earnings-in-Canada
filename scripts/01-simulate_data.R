#### Simulate data ####
# In this simulation, we focus on two different age categories for birth rate data: younger and older groups.
# The simulation starts with birth rate of 6 age groups.
# The simulated data is derived from a normal distribution instead of a poisson distribution since birth rate can be more than just integers.
# By applying the abs() function, we guarantee the recording of only positive birth rates for the older age group.
